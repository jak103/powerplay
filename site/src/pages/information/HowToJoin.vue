      <p class="text-body1">
        The way our league works is that the team managers are responsible for 
        managing their respective teams, including finding and rostering players. 
        The adult league directors are not responsible for that process. 
        However, to help facilitate league growth, the adult league directors 
        will help non-league players connect with team managers.  
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-body1">
        The League currently has limited space for new players.

      <p class="text-body1">
        We are currently working on a new process to help connect new and

        more experienced players to provide coaching and mentorship, their participation 
        is subject to approval by the league's Director to ensure a fair and balanced 
        playing field.
