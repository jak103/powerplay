      <h2>How To Join</h2>
      <p>
        The way our league works is that the team managers are responsible for 
        managing their respective teams, including finding and rostering players. 
        The adult league directors are not responsible for that process. 
        However, to help facilitate league growth, the adult league directors 
        will help non-league players connect with team managers.  
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The League currently has limited space for new players. 
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Update:
      </p>

      <p>
        We are currently working on a new process to help connect new and 
        interested players with teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we transition to a new process, we ask that you send an email to 
        <a href=mailto:jonahn@ecclesice.com>jonahn@ecclesice.com</a> if you are 
        interested in joining the league.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please provide as much information as possible about your hockey 
        experience in the email.

        is subject to approval by the league's Director to ensure a fair and balanced 
        playing field.
