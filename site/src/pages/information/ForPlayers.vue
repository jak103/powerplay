      <h2>Sportsmanship and Code of Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        All players are expected to conduct themselves in a sportsman-like manner 
        both on and off the ice. This includes, but is not limited to, respect 
        for the officials, scorekeepers, teammates, opponents, spectators, rink 
        employees, all other patrons and to the facility.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The George S. Eccles Ice Center (hereafter known as “EIC”) reserves the 
        right and the authority to disqualify, suspend, or remove any team manager, 
        coach, player, spectator, or team which behaves in an unsportsmanlike 
        manner before, during, or after a game.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The possession of alcohol, tobacco products, or illegal drugs is strictly 
        prohibited at the EIC, which includes the building, locker rooms, and 
        parking lot. Any player found in possession will face disciplinary action 
        by the Adult League Director(s) with the possibility of suspension from 
        the league and the possibility of further legal action.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Any team or player(s) who are in the presence of alcohol, tobacco products, 
        or illegal drugs should report it to the Adult League Director(s) or rink 
        staff immediately. Failure to report could result in being suspended from 
        the league without refunds and the possibility of legal action.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Parents and Athletes</h2>
      <p>
        Parents and athletes need to manage their PowerPlay accounts to ensure 
        they get the most out of their George S. Eccles Ice Center experience 
        during each sporting season. With their accounts properly configured, 
        athletes and their families will receive communications according to their 
        preferences and be able to complete registrations more efficiently.
