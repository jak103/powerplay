    <h1>Team Manager Information</h1>

    <h2>Coaches & Managers</h2>
    <p>
      One of the essential functions of coaches and team managers is to manage
      team communication with players and the team. If you are a coach or team
      manager, SportsEngine has created a Team Management Guide for Coaches and
      Team Managers to help you use our website and mobile app to efficiently
      and effectively communicate and manage your teams.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibilities of the Team Manager</h2>
    <p>
      Establish and maintain a full roster based on the league rules and
      guidelines stipulated in the policy and procedures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Establish reliable and effective communication with the Adult League
      Director(s)
    </p>

    <p>
      The score sheet is an official document of the league. Managers need to
      check with the scorekeeper before each game to coordinate messages from
      the Adult League Director(s) or address any suspensions assessed to their
      players. Also, to coordinate a check-in of players on the roster or add
      any subs to the roster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ensure that the team fees are made on time and paid within the time
      stipulated by the Adult League Directors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon request from the team manager, a copy of the scoresheet will be
      provided to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ensure that a goalie is available to play at all games. Coordinate
      available goalies from the goalie list to substitute in the event of the
      absence of the goalie on the team roster, and then inform the Adult League
      Director(s) or scorekeeper of the goalie substitution so it can be
      annotated on the score sheet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ensure that every team member understands the Policies and Procedures and
      that if there are any discrepancies or concerns, address them with Adult
      League Director(s) solely. Participation in the EIC-RHL indicates that all
      participants have read the policies and procedures set forth by the EIC
      and fully understand the policies and procedures, and agree to comply with
      them in their entirety.
    </p>

    <h2>Team Rosters</h2>
    <p>
      Rostering players is now easy and quick through the new SportsEngine
      platform. You will need to log in through the website portal to do so.
      Once you have logged in, you will go to your respective team page. Then on
      the left-hand side, you will see the edit mode, turn this on and go to
      your roster. You will see "Add Player," by clicking on this, you will add
      a new player. Here you can add the player to your roster, if registered,
      through the member directory. If you have any questions, please reach out
      to an Adult League Director.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each team roster must have at least nine players and one goalie—and no
      more than 16 players—to register. The team's designated secondary goalie
      maybe a 17th player if necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are no additional substitute players over the roster of 16. If a
      team rosters 16 players and wants to add an additional player, another
      player must be dropped to keep the roster at a maximum of 16 players.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is the responsibility of the team and the team manager to meet the
      minimum and maximum requirements for rosters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rosters are open to adding/removing players until the rosters are frozen
      following the 4th scheduled game. No players will be added or removed from
      a team's roster except with the approval of the Adult League Director(s).
    </p>

    <p>
      It is the responsibility of the Team Manager to keep his team roster
      current. Any changes must be transacted via email between the Team Manager
      and the Adult League Director(s).
    </p>

    <p>
      (Please see Adult League Policies and Procedures Manual Section H for all
      policies and procedures of Team Rosters.)
    </p>

    <h2>League Fees & Payments</h2>
    <p>
      League fees are based on a team fee, not individual fees. The per-player
      fee charged by a team manager may be different with each team based on the
      number of players per team or other fees charged by a particular team over
      and above the EIC-RHL Fee (Eccles Ice Center Recreational Hockey League).
      (Please be aware that a service fee is connected to all team fees
      regardless of payment method.) team Managers will now receive an invoice
      from the Adult League Directors, which can be paid through the
      SportsEngine platform.
    </p>

    <h4>Team fees will be as follows:</h4>

    <p>
      The base team fee is $2,500.00. There will be a discounted price of
      $100.00 given to teams that pay in full by the team’s first scheduled
      game, making the team cost $2,400.00
    </p>

    <p>Team and player fees are non-refundable.</p>

    <h3>Team suspension for non-payment of fees:</h3>

    <p>
      Teams who have not paid in full by the respective due dates, with final
      payment due no later than the day of the team’s fourth scheduled game,
      will be placed on suspension. Missed games due to suspension will be
      forfeited and not rescheduled. The team will not be eligible for any other
      games, including playoffs, until payment in full is received.
    </p>
